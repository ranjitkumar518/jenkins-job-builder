I created this file because i didn't find any solution and I am not able to create a issue in this repo. when i am trying to create a jenkins job using the
jenkins job builder plugin using the below code for a maven build to conditional publish  to only successful prebuilds. 
but i am getting the below error.

Here is the code:

    publishers:
      - conditional-publisher:
           condition-kind: current-status
           condition-worst: FAILURE
           condition-best: SUCCESS
    action:
      publishers:
        - trigger-parameterized-builds:
            - project: default_job
              current-parameters: true
              trigger-with-no-params: false
